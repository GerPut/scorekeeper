This is a simple scorekeeping app for a game of choice. The project has a neumorphic design that I looked up and learned to create. The basic function of this game is controlled by 3 buttons. Player buttons update the scores of player one and two. Once the winning score is reached the player buttons become inactive and reset should be pressed to restart the app again. At the moment there is no point deduction function or winning score adjustment. Future updates can be made.
